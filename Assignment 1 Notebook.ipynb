    "<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n",
    "<p>The insights provided have made it clear that the e-commerce business has room to optimize its logistical and customer support related processes. Concerning logistical processes, the e-commerce business needs to better their percentage of late deliveries, with approximately 59.77% of deliveries not reaching their target destination on time. This is coupled with the fact that the average discount provided for late deliveries is approximately 13% greater than that of timely deliveries. Offering large discounts on more than 59.77% deliveries is costly, and affects the profitability of the business. To improve the delivery time, the business could investigate their shipping partners, and perhaps search for new ones. Looking inward, the e-commerce business could perhaps find a way to spread the load amongst all of their warehouse blocks more efficiently since block F manages 50% more products than any of the other blocks individually. If block F is an operational bottleneck, then average shipping times could be improved. Relating to more delivery logistics, the business has assigned a factor of importance on their products. Their “high” importance products arrive late 64.97% of the time while their low to medium importance products arrive late 59.27% and 59.04% of the time. The e-commerce business should be prioritizing the high importance products more so than the low to medium importance products to ensure customer satisfaction and retention. The customer service portion of the business has room for optimizations as well. Given that the average number of care calls increases the more expensive the product is, the business should enact methods to ensure customers who purchase pricier products have their needs met earlier to avoid costly repeat customer service interactions. Overall. by addressing these logistical and customer service challenges the e-commerce business could position itself well to drive profitability and customer retention into the future.</p>"
